# Accelerometer and Gyroscope Synthetic Data Calculation Algorithm

This repository contains an algorithm for calculating **synthetic accelerometer and gyroscope data** based on GPS, providing the ability to classify driver behavior for devices that do not have accelerometer or gyroscope sensors.

## Key Features

- **Quaternion Construction**: The method constructs quaternions to describe rotations.
- **Krylov-Euler Conversion**: Quaternions are then converted to Krylov-Euler angles.
- **Driver Behavior Classification**: Synthetic data allows classification of driver behavior.
- **Open Source Validation and Visualization**: The method has been validated and visualized
